 *
 * Implement a simple LinkedList
 * You will need to create a LinkedListNode class, which represents each item/node in the linked list
 * Assume that the elements in the linked list are all of type int
 * Required functionality...
 * - head(): get head node of list
 * - tail(): get tail node of list
 * - add(): add element to the end of the list
 * - insert(): insert an element at a given index position
 * - push(): add element to the beginning of the list
 * - pop(): remove head of list and return the node that was removed
 * - clear(): remove all elements in the list
 * - toString(): return a String representation of the list
 * 
 * Create a driver class called TestLinkedList. In the main method, create an instance
 * of LinkedList and test all of its methods at least once. (Print the list as needed
 * to prove the methods worked.)
